                    <span style="font-size:24px;">Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration 
                        among billions of people around the world. A liturgical feast central to Christianity, Christmas preparation begins on the First Sunday of Advent and it is followed by Christmastide, 
                        which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is observed religiously by a majority of 
                        Christians, as well as celebrated culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season. The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the 
                        New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had 
                        no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.There are different hypotheses 
                        regarding the date of Jesus's birth. In the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25, the date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire. It is nine months after 
                        Annunciation on March 25, also the Roman date of the spring equinox.</span>

                    <span style="font-size:24px;">The gospels of Luke and Matthew describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary. In the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem 
                        in order to be counted for a census, and Jesus is born there and placed in a manger.[20] Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and three shepherds come to adore him. In the Gospel of Matthew, 
                        by contrast, three magi follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews. King Herod orders the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family 
                        flees to Egypt and later returns to Nazareth.</span>

                    <span style="font-size:24px;">Christmas, the celebration of Jesus Christ’s birth, began to be observed by Christians as early as the 2nd century. However, there was no fixed date at first. 
                        The earliest known reference to December 25 as Jesus' birthday appears in a Roman calendar from 336 AD. This date may have been chosen to align with the Roman pagan festival of 
                        Sol Invictus (the "Unconquered Sun"), celebrated around the winter solstice. By the 4th century, important Christian leaders like Augustine and John Chrysostom supported December 
                        25 as the official date. In the Eastern Church, however, Jesus’ birth was initially celebrated on January 6 alongside the Epiphany (commemorating Jesus’ baptism).
                        During the Middle Ages, Christmas grew into a major religious and cultural event. It included fasting before the holiday (Advent), followed by festive activities like feasts, 
                        plays (like the Nativity), and gift-giving. The 12-day Christmas season (Dec 25–Jan 5) became established as “Christmastide.” However, in the 17th century, Puritans in England 
                        and colonial America opposed Christmas, calling it a pagan-inspired or Catholic tradition. They even banned it in some areas. The holiday was restored later and gradually became 
                        popular again, especially in Europe and North America, leading to the modern form we know today.</span>
