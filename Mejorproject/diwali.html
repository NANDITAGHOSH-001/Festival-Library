                                                  The name comes from Sanskrit Deepavali, meaning a “row of lamps.” During Diwali, people light diyas (clay oil lamps), decorate homes with rangoli (colorful floor art), 
                                                  wear new clothes, exchange sweets and gifts, and set off fireworks to symbolize the victory of light over darkness and good over evil.</span>
