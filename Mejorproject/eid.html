                    <span style="font-size:24px;">Eid refers to two major Islamic festivals celebrated worldwide, each embodying profound spiritual meaning and communal joy:
                        <li><strong>Eid al‑Fitr</strong> –The "Festival of Breaking the Fast"—marks the end of Ramadan, a month of dawn‑to‑dusk fasting, prayer, and reflection. 
                                                          It begins on 1eshawwal, the next lunar month, and is celebrated with dawn prayers, charity (zakat al‑Fitr), new clothes, 
                                                          feasts, sweets, gift-giving, and visits to family and friends.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eid al‑Adha</strong> –The "Festival of Sacrifice"—occurs on the 10th of Dhu al-Hijjah, coinciding with the culmination of the Hajj pilgrimage. 
                                                          It honors Prophet Ibrahim’s devotion by commemorating his readiness to sacrifice his son. The day begins with special prayers, 
                                                          followed by the qurbani ritual (sacrificial animal), with meat distributed among family, relatives, and the poor—emphasizing 
                                                          charity, obedience, and communal responsibility. Celebrations include feasts, social gatherings, gift-giving, and supporting those in need .</li></span>

        <span style="font-size:24px">Eid al‑Fitr and Eid al‑Adha were both instituted by the Prophet Muhammad around 624 CE, shortly after his migration (Hijrah) to Medina—replacing pre-Islamic festivals with uniquely 
                                     Islamic celebrations of worship and gratitude. The term Eid (عِيد) means “festival” or “recurring celebration,” with Fitr referring to the breaking of the Ramadan fast, and Adha 
                                     denoting sacrifice . According to hadith, Muhammad observed that the people of Medina already celebrated certain festive days and declared that Allah had granted Muslims two superior days: Eid al‑Fitr and Eid al‑Adha.</span>

                <td>
                    <span style="font-size:24px">Eid celebrations — both Eid al‑Fitr and Eid al‑Adha — deeply enrich communities through shared worship, charity, and social unity. At dawn, Muslims gather in mosques or open fields for Salat al‑Eid, 
                                                 reinforcing equality and collective faith across social divides. Through Zakat al‑Fitr on Eid al‑Fitr and Qurbani on Eid al‑Adha, wealth and sacrificial meat are equitably distributed to the needy, 
                                                 ensuring that no one is forgotten . Mosques and community organizations host charitable drives, food distributions, blood donation camps, and interfaith festivals—extending inclusion and support beyond mere ritual. 
                                                 These acts of generosity not only provide physical aid but also foster social cohesion, heal divisions, and cultivate intercommunity understanding and empathy.</span>
