                        The 10th day of this month, known as Ashura, holds deep religious significance. For Sunni Muslims, Ashura commemorates the day Prophet Moses 
                        parted the Red Sea and saved the Israelites, observed through optional fasting and expressions of gratitude. For Shia Muslims, it is a solemn day 
                        of mourning, marking the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, who was killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE. 
                        Shia communities observe intense mourning rituals during the first ten days of Muharram, especially on Ashura. Additionally, during this month, 
                        the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem was initially designated as the first direction of Muslim prayer.</span>

                    <span style="font-size:24px;">Muharram, meaning "sacred," is the first month of the Islamic calendar and can have up to thirty days. It is one of 
                        the four sacred months in which warfare is strictly forbidden—a tradition that dates back to pre-Islamic times. The name "Muharram" is derived 
                        from the older term "Muharram Safar," used in the ancient Arab calendar to distinguish between two months: Safar I (considered sacred) and 
                        Safar II (not sacred). Over time, the adjective "Muharram" evolved to become the proper name of the first month of the Islamic year.</span>

                        like the parting of the Red Sea by Moses, Noah’s Ark landing, and other blessings, celebrated through fasting and pious acts. In some Sunni regions, 
                        it also includes festive traditions. For Shia Muslims, Ashura is a solemn day of mourning for the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali, the Prophet 
                        Muhammad’s grandson, at the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE. Shia communities mark the day with processions, gatherings, and reenactments, viewing 
                        it as a protest against injustice and a form of spiritual struggle.</span>
