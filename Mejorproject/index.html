    <span style="font-size:24px">Hi, myself Nandita, just start learning about website building and this is my first attempt at creating a website about the Festivals of India. 
                                 Iâ€™ve tried my best to include all the important details, but if you find any mistakes or missing information, please forgive me. Your support and 
                                 suggestions are always welcome! The Festivals of India are full of joy, color, spirituality, and tradition. Each one has its own unique story, 
                                 customs, and significance. Through this website, I have tried to collect and present information about some of the most celebrated festivals like 
                                 Diwali, Holi, Durga Puja, Kali Puja, and many others. Since I am still learning, there might be a few errors or missing details. Please kindly forgive 
                                 me for that. Your feedback, suggestions, or encouragement would mean a lot and help me improve further.
                                 Thank you for visiting my website and being a part of my learning journey!</span>
