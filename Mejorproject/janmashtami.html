                    <span style="font-size:24px;">Janmashtami, also known as Krishna Janmashtami or Gokulashtami, is one of the most significant festivals in the Hindu calendar. 
                        It marks the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, who was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in a prison cell in Mathura to end the tyranny of the evil king Kansa.
                        The festival usually takes place in the month of Bhadrapada (August–September) as per the Hindu lunar calendar. Devotees observe a strict fast, which is broken only after midnight, 
                        the time believed to be Krishna's birth moment. Temples and households are decorated with flowers, lights, and miniature scenes from Krishna's life, especially his childhood mischiefs like stealing butter.
                        Throughout the day and night, devotional songs (bhajans), dance-dramas (Ras Leela), and scripture readings from the Bhagavad Gita are performed. Children often dress up as Lord Krishna and Radha, adding charm to the celebration. 
                        One of the most popular Janmashtami traditions is the Dahi Handi festival, especially in Maharashtra. Here, a clay pot filled with curd, butter, or sweets is suspended high above the ground, and groups of young men (called Govindas) 
                        form human pyramids to reach and break the pot. This act symbolizes Krishna’s love for butter and his playful, mischievous nature.</span>

                    <span style="font-size:24px;">Information about Krishna's life is noted in the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and Bhagavata Purana. Krishna is the eighth son of Devaki (mother) and Vasudeva (father). Surrounding the time of his birth, persecution was rampant, 
                    freedoms were being denied, and King Kamsa's life was threatened. Krishna was born within a prison in Mathura, India where his parents were constrained by his uncle, Kamsa. During Devaki's wedding, Kamsa was warned by a celestial voice that 
                    Devaki's eighth son would be the cause of his death. In an effort to defy this prophesy, Kamsa imprisoned his sister Devaki and her husband and promptly killed the first six of her newborns after their birth. The guards responsible for 
                    keeping watch over Devaki's cell fell asleep and the cell doors were miraculously opened at the time of Krishna's birth. These events allowed Vasudeva to send Krishna across the Yamuna River to his foster parents, Yashoda (mother) and Nanda (father). 
                    This legend is celebrated on Janmashtami by people keeping fasts, singing devotional songs of love for Krishna, and keeping a vigil into the night. Throughout Krishna's childhood and young adult life, Balarama, Krishna's half-brother, was a 
                    "constant companion" for him. Balarama joined Krishna in the major events that are celebrated in Vraja, Brindavan, Dravarka, and Mathura such as stealing butter, chasing calves, playing in the cow pens, and participating in wrestling matches.</span>

                    <span style="font-size:24px;">Krishna Janmashtami celebrates the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu, and holds deep religious and cultural importance across India and among Hindus worldwide. Devotees observe the festival with fasting, 
                        devotional singing, and prayers, often lasting through the night to mark Krishna’s midnight birth. Temples and homes are beautifully decorated with flowers, lights, and rangoli. In regions like Mathura and Vrindavan—associated with Krishna’s 
                        life—pilgrims gather in large numbers. Rasa Lila or Krishna Lila, dramatic enactments of Krishna’s childhood and youth, are performed in many states such as Manipur, Assam, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. These performances involve music, dance, and storytelling, 
                        often staged by local youth groups.At midnight, Krishna idols are bathed, dressed, and placed in cradles, symbolizing his birth. Families then break their fast by sharing sweets and prasadam. Women often draw tiny footprints at their doors to welcome baby 
                        Krishna into their homes. The next day, Dahi Handi is celebrated, where groups of boys form human pyramids to break an earthen pot filled with curd, echoing Krishna’s childhood mischief.Janmashtami beautifully blends spirituality, culture, and community, inspiring devotion and joy across all age groups.</span>
